Known things that should be done.
=================================

- Support for files that are including files using a path. I.e for the moment
  it's only supported when doing like this
    #include "foo.h"

  but if a file include like this, it won't work as supposed to
    #include "baa/foo"

- The -f parameter isn't working anymore, since rewriting the traversal
  function.
